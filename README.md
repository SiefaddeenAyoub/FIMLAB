# SIEM Azure Sentinel

## Objective

 I set up Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connected it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot. We will observe live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from all around the world. We will use a custom PowerShell script to look up the attackers Geolocation information and plot it on the Azure Sentinel Map!

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Used custom PowerShell script to extract security events from Windows Event Viewer which was then delivered to a third-party API to break down the geolocation data.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Configured Azure Sentinel workbook to display global attack data (Brute Force Attacks) on the world map depending on attack location.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
